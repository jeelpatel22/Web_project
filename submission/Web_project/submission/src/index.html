      <!-- Basic Description of the Zebra Jumping Spider -->
      <div class="basic-description">
        <dfn>
          The <strong><mark>Zebra Spider (Salticus scenicus)</mark></strong
          >, also known as the Zebra Jumping Spider or Salticidae, is a small
          and agile arachnid found in various parts of North America, including
          the United States and Canada. It belongs to the Salticidae family,
          which is known for its excellent jumping ability and unique hunting
          techniques.
        </dfn>
        <p>
          Male zebra spiders are 5–6 mm long, compared to the females' mm
          length.The chelicerae of male zebra spiders are noticeably larger than
          those of females. Although the anterior and posterior lateral eyes
          (ALE, PLE) are also huge in comparison to the extremely small
          posterior median eyes (PME), the anterior and posterior median eyes
          (AME) are particularly enlarged in spiders of the Salticidae family.
          It has eight eyes altogether, with the exceptional binocular vision
          being mostly attributed to the unusually big anterior median eyes.
          These little spiders have white stripes on their black bodies.

            They are longer than the majority of jumping spiders and have thin
            fake waists that give them an antlike appearance. These spiders will
            also adopt the hues of various ant species. In order to blend in
            better, they also wave two of their legs around like antennae.

          When the angle occupied by the prey by their lateral eyes surpasses
          5.5°, they turn towards the prey. Only moving objects evoke
          orientation; the prey's velocity plays no role in determining reaction
          distance.

          In the spring and summer, if you happen to see a male and female zebra
          spider, you might be able to witness a spectacular display. Female
          zebra jumping spiders have high expectations because the males must
          engage in an impressive dance before they may feed.
        </li>
        <li>
          Amazingly, unlike grasshoppers, jumping spiders don't have unique leg
          muscles that enable them to leap.

        <h4>The reproduction in the zebra spider</h4>
        <p>
          In the spring and summer, this species reproduces.A courtship dance is
          performed by the male spider when it first encounters a female. They
          move their pedipalps, front legs, and abdomen up and down while
          dancing.Males communicate their desire to mate with females by
          flashing their striped markings during the courtship dance. The ritual
          of courtship strongly depends on vision. The likelihood that the
          female will wish to mate increases with improved dancing. Males should
          exercise caution when approaching females since they run the risk of
          being attacked or thought to be a prey species. The female will allow
          the man to approach if she is impressed by his dance.
        </p>
        <h4>how they hunt</h4>
        <p>
          When the angle occupied by the prey by their lateral eyes surpasses
          5.5°, they turn towards the prey. Only moving objects evoke
          orientation; the prey's velocity plays no role in determining reaction
          distance. Size and speed of the prey affect the likelihood that
          stalking will occur after orienting. As the zebra spider approaches
          its (stationary) victim, its stalk velocity gradually decreases.
